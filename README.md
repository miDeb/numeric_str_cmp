# numeric_str_cmp

This was a prototype for a numeric string comparison algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that compares two strings as the number they represent,
meant to be used in https://github.com/uutils/coreutils.
The actual implementation that [I proposed and that got merged](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/pull/2070)
is somewhat different from this one.

Have a great day!
